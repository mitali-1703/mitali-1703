## Hi there 👋,           
I'm Mitali Agrawal, a Junior Year Computer Science Engineering Undergrad at 👨‍💻 JECRC University pursuing B.Tech Computer Science.  I am a tech and coding enthusiast with a strong passion to be an Android Developer and want to see myself as a Software Developer in future. I love spending time with techy stuffs, exploring new things and socializing.

## 🧐 About
- 🏄‍ Community girl who loves being involved in communities and help students grow.
- 😄 I love participating in hackathons and open-source programs a lot.
- 🌱 I love to speak at public events and looking forward  as a motivator at many events. I also guide my peers related to my tech field.
- 🔭 I have worked as a Web Development Co-Lead at GDSC-JU for a tenure of 10months.
- ⚡ After exploring Web Development for about 10months , I have recently started with Android development and I am literally loving it and working daily on it to be better than what I was yesterday.
- ⚡ I know C , C++ , Core Java , Python(basic) and basic level Data Structures and Algorithms.
- ⚡ When I'm not doing something for enhancing my skills or exploring opportunities, I focus on skilling and learning for future steps of my career. I don't like to waste a second of my time doing something that's not profitable for my career or fitness while owning my actions rather than waiting for an outcome.
- 👯 And Many More...
